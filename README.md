# CRUD-operation-using-Django
This is a README file for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation project implemented using Django framework. The project allows you to perform basic database operations on a specific data model through a web interface.

Project Overview
The CRUD operation project using Django aims to demonstrate the implementation of a simple web application that interacts with a database. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where Django provides a robust framework for handling the backend logic.

The project includes the following main features:

Create: Users can create new records by filling out a form and submitting the data. The input is validated, and the record is stored in the database.

Read: Users can view the existing records stored in the database. The data is displayed in a user-friendly manner, making it easy to read and navigate through the records.

Update: Users can update the existing records by selecting a specific record, making the necessary modifications, and saving the changes. The updated data is then stored back in the database.

Delete: Users can delete specific records from the database by selecting the record and confirming the deletion. Once deleted, the record is permanently removed from the database.
